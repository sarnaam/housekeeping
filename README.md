HouseKeeping Web Interface

This is a combination of HTML files for the front end web interface for the topic given HOUSEKEEPING.

The Artistry.html page is the main page given to observe as the home page for this website following each tabs inside according to the question. 
Since I'm working on for details and precision I kept the files on HTML itself since only the front end is the main objective instead of connecting it with Database and by using PHP. It is an easy job for attaching and improving the code using the required objectives using PHP, but the time given for my work was limited and I have attained maximum design possible using my attributes. The only thing required is to connect it with Xampp and use PHP to create a localhost database connectivity and give method and preferred action pages to acquire the informations to the database when user submits the wanted HouseKeeping Services. So the person using my interface or website can start from the Artsitry.html page.

Thank You.
